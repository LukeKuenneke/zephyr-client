ZEPHYR for JIRA Client
    A python client for the Zephyr for Jira plugin from SmartBear.
    Official API documentation is NOT reliable, but can be found here:
    https://getzephyr.docs.apiary.io

inspired by https://github.com/pycontribs/jira


State of the project:
Until I find a better way to mock the responses, there are no tests.  This is something I've only recently begun learning about, and my knowledge of pytest and unittest mocks is incomplete to say the least.
